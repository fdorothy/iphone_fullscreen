This is an example of how to do a fullscreen layout in Safari with an iPhone.

This makes use of https://github.com/mvasin/react-div-100vh in conjunction with some other features that allow us to hide the address bar when swiping down.

This ensures that the content is always stretched the full extent of visible space, and that the address bar and tabs of Safari can be hidden.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
